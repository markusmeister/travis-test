You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],

To cite that equation use the format \\@ref(eq:name) The equation label has to appear after the body of the equation code, like this: \\begin{equation} \\tilde h(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\,e^{i\\omega t&#39;} h(t&#39;) \\, dt&#39; (\\#eq:binom) \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right)=\\binom{n}{k}p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} (\\#eq:binom) \\end{equation} \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right)=\\binom{n}{k}p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Then you can cite the equation, like this: (??). Changed this 4:49PM. 2.4 Equation numbering There is some weirdness about how equation numbering is handled in the PDF versus the HTML versions of the book. In the PDF output equations are numbered by default. Every line of an equation will get numbered except if it is inside $$ $$. has \\notag at the end of line, before the \\\\. is in an {equation*} or {align*} environment where there are no labels is in a {split} environment with a single label But in the HTML output an equation is unnumbered by default, except if it contains an explicit equation label. For more details see here. So, to make sure we get the same numbering in PDF and HTML we should do this: An unnumbered display equation should be enclosed with $$ $$ or in environments {equation*} or {align*}. A numbered display equation should include a single label. Here are some examples: This equation will get a number in PDF but not in HTML, which is a mistake! This gets no number in PDF or HTML: And this gets a number in both PDF and HTML: 2.5 Multi-line equation with multiple labels Here is a long equation stretching over several lines, first with a single number …then with multiple numbers I wrote some grep routines that produce automatic equation labels, for example in the study guide which contains several hundred equations. Every one of those has a label, even though we rarely cite those labels. "],
